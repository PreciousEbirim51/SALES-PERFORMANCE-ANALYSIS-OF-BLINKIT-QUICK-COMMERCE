INTRODUCTION

This report presents a comprehensive tier-wise performance analysis of Blinkit retail operations across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities in India. The analysis reveals significant variations in consumer behavior, outlet performance, and product preferences across different city tiers To Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities, Understand regional variations in product preferences, outlet performance, and customer behavior, Provide actionable recommendations to tailor strategies for each city tier, Support data-informed decision-making for inventory planning, marketing, expansion, and operational improvements.

PRE ANALYSIS

A pre-analysis phase was conducted to establish an analytical framework before the creation of the dashboard. This pre-analysis phase involves:

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing during the analysis.
Potential Insights: I was able to uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.
Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Microsoft Power BI was the primary analysis and visualization tool used for this project, the Power BI features used include;

DAX Functions
Interactive Visualizations
Power Query
Calculated Columns and Measures
